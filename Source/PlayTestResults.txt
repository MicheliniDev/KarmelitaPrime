Projectile after spin land gets repetitive
Block when idle gets really annoying

Add the projectile - spin aim transition in fake phase 3
Perhaps also make phase 1 projectiles double by default


5 slashes shouldn't be possible --FIXED?
Phase 3 make wind blade take longer to transition to idle --DONE

Introduce the wind blades at fake phase 3 --CHANGED TO P2

Melee attacks are quite hard to avoid --FIXED
Jump spin after cyclone is stupid --FIXED

Reduce cyclone, slash and spin attack speed --DONE
Add more transitions to approach block transitioner on phase 2 --DONE
Fix the flash null reference as it's leading to invincibility bugs --DONE
Reduce cyclone antic - spin attack chance in phase 2 (happens way too often) --DONE
Increase threshold for spin attack from cyclone antic --DONE
Make camera transition to good camera after the roar --DONE
