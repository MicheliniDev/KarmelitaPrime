# KarmelitaPrime
A brutal rework for Skarrsinger Karmelita, one the major bosses in Hollow Knight Silksong.
Offering mixups

# Installation

The mod can be downloaded via Thunderstore's Mod Manager and  or you can install it manually by:

1. Downloading the last stable version of BepInEx in https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases
2. Extracting BepInEx to the game's root folder(the one with Hollow Knight Silksong.exe).
3. Starting the game to generate the necessary files and folder for BepInEx.
4. Placing the dll file in the BepInEx/plugins folder.

# General Changes

- Contact damage is disabled on Karmelita when she's not attacking.
- Nail Clashes now give silk and do damage to the boss (even on the projectiles).
